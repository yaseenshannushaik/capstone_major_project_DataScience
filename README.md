## 📊 Objectives

- Import and preprocess signal data from a CSV file.
- Perform signal analysis, including:
  - Data inspection
  - Noise handling (if applicable)
  - Signal transformation (e.g., Fourier Transform, smoothing, etc.)
- Visualize signal trends using plots.
- Extract insights from patterns in the signal data.

## 📈 Sample Features (depending on your implementation)

* Signal amplitude-time plots.
* Statistical summary of signal patterns.
* Frequency domain analysis (if applied).
* Anomaly detection or trend identification.
